**Abstract:**  
The cognitive abilities of humans are distinctive among primates, but their molecular and cellular substrates are poorly understood. We used comparative single-nucleus transcriptomics to analyze samples of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from adult humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, rhesus macaques, and common marmosets to understand human-specific features of the neocortex. Human, chimpanzee, and gorilla MTG showed highly similar cell-type composition and laminar organization as well as a large shift in proportions of deep-layer intratelencephalic-projecting neurons compared with macaque and marmoset MTG. Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes had more-divergent expression across species compared with neurons or oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and neuronal expression diverged more rapidly on the human lineage. Only a few hundred genes showed human-specific patterning, suggesting that relatively few cellular and molecular changes distinctively define adult human cortical structure.

**Abstract:**  
With the rapid advances in single-cell sequencing technologies, novel types of studies into the cell-type makeup of the brain have become possible. Biologists often analyze large and complex single-cell transcriptomic datasets to enhance knowledge of the intricate features of cellular and molecular tissue organization. A particular area of interest is the study of whether cell types and their gene regulation are conserved across species during evolution. However, in-depth comparisons across species of such high-dimensional, multi-modal single-cell data pose considerable visualization challenges. This paper introduces Cytosplore Simian Viewer, a visualization system that combines various views and linked interaction methods for comparative analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets across multiple species. Cytosplore Simian Viewer enables biologists to help gain insights into the cell type and gene expression differences and similarities among different species, particularly focusing on comparing human data to other species. The system validation in discovery research on real-world datasets demonstrates its utility in visualizing valuable results related to the evolutionary development of the middle temporal gyrus.
