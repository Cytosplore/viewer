				Cytosplore Viewer is an interactive visual analytics system for the exploration of single cell and spatial transcriptomics data published in the 
				<a href="http://celltypes.brain-map.org/" target="new">Allen Cell Types Database</a>
				and for a number of the curated, authoritative data resources of the <a href="https://www.portal.brain-bican.org/" target="_blank">Brain Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN)</a>, in particular the <a href="https://www.portal.brain-bican.org/teams/hmba" target="_blank">Human and Mammalian Brain Atlas (HMBA)</a>.
				<br /><br />
				Launched in 2019, Cytosplore Viewer is designed to leverage fast local compute and compressed data access for the linked exploration of multi-modal spatial and single cell datasets. Specific focus is multi-resolution detail analyses across multiple datasets, for instance:
				<ul>
					<li><b>On-the-fly visual cross-species comparative visualization</b> of cell types and their convergent and divergent features across  species.</li>
					<li><b>On-the-fly multi-omics integration</b> of ATAC-seq, Patch-seq, spatial and single-cell transcriptomics by leveraging standardized taxonomy mapping to cross-modal searches (e.g. spatial co-expression of ATAC and RNA seq data.</li>
					<li><b>Deepdives in single-cell and spatial data</b> for in-depth re-analysis of subsets of cells. Specific niche functionalities are on-the-fly re-embedding using a complementary dimensionality reduction to UMAP, local gene expression gradients detection, differential expression analysis and manual annotation / correction facilities.</li>
				</ul>

				Cytosplore Viewer allows an interactive exploration of hierarchies of cell types. One can visualize
				transcriptome-wide gene expression in combination with metadata of individual cells, perform
				differential analyses and statistics between manual selections of cells, or between pre-defined clusters
				throughout the cellular hierarchy and more.

			Cytosplore Viewer is a stand-alone application built on top of ManiVault Studio [citation], a plugin-based high-performance application building environment for Windows, MacOS and Linux. It enables agile, low-effort construction of specialized data viewers for integrated exploration across datasets. Departing from a single application installer, different BICAN data viewers can be ingested as system state files that are self-contained, including compressed data and GUI configurations. In addition, multiple mechanisms are available to ingest slices of data and taxonomy versions from the ABC-atlas portal, either through a python bridge, through ingestion of standardized taxonomy file formats or URL transfer of ABC atlas cell selections into Cytosplore.

				Cytosplore Viewer provides a complementary data analysis and visualization to the HMBA data visualization web portal, focusing on fast local compute for the linked exploration of multi-modal spatial and single cell datasets. It offers on high interactivity, low-latency  and on-the-fly analyses, complementing the BKP functionality with interactive, visual analytics across multiple datasets, providing for instance : 
				<ul>
					<li><b>Deepdives in single-cell and spatial data</b> for in-depth re-analysis of subsets of cells, either dispatched from the HMBA data portal, or directly in Cytosplore Viewer. Specific niche functionalities are on-the-fly re-embedding, local gene expression gradients detection, differential expression analysis and manual annotation / correction facilities.</li>
					<li><b>Comparative visualization</b> for direct comparative analyses of single cell and spatial data across multiple species and / or between brain regions. Central in these comparisons is the identification of conserved and diverging features patterns across these datasets and relate these to evolutionary and anatomical prior knowledge.</li>
					<li><b>Multimodal single-cell feature integration</b> for linked visualization of for instance patch-seq data (for exploration of annotated t-typed cells in relation to their morphological and electrophysiological features) and ATAC-seq / spatial / RNA-seq combinations.</li>
				</ul>
