The data size and computational demands of interactive A-tSNE require
sufficiently modern hardware to ensure the desired responsiveness in
Cytosplore MTG Viewer. We recommend the following:

-   Windows 7 or higher (64bits)

-   Intel Core i7 with 2 cores or better (preferably generation 6 or
    higher)

-   8GB of memory or more

-   Dedicated Graphics Card (preferably nVidia GTX 960 or better) with
    at least 2GB of GPU memory

Configurations with lesser specifications may work, but will result in
longer wait times for data loading and computing. We have tested
Cytosplore MTG Viewer on different configurations, including Windows 7
and Windows 10, intel Core i7 and intel Xeon CPUs as well as different
Graphics Cards (nvidia GTX 980, GTX 1080, GTX Titan, AMD Radeon r9 M290,
and AMD Radeon Pro 460). It is highly recommended to update the drivers
of the graphics card to the latest versions prior to installing
Cytosplore MTG Viewer. Remote operation of Cytosplore MTG Viewer through
Remote Desktop is not supported.

If you have any problems just [send us a mail][mail], including your configuration.
