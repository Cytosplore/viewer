The default organization of the different views can be customized by
clicking and dragging on the top bar of each view. The organization of
the windows can be cusomized as follows:

-   **Move a view within the application window:** drag and drop within
    the application window will reorganize the other views. Dropping the
    view in the middle of another view will add it as a tab to the
    target view.
-   **Resize a view:** each of the views can be resized by moving the
    mouse over the boundary of the view: arrows appear, and the border
    can be dragged to resize the view.
-   **Dock a view outside of the application:** drag and drop to a
    location outside of the application window will float the view as a
    separate window, while maintaining the interactive links to all
    other views. This can be convenient for instance on a PC with two
    screens: views can be docked to a second screen.
-   **Close a view:** a view can be closed by clicking the X in the
    right upper corner of each view.
-   **Retrieve a closed view:** each view can be retrieved by
    right-clicking on the top bar of a view: this will bing up a list of
    views that can be toggled on or off. See below for an example.
