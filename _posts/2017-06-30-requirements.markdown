The goal of Cytsoplore MTG Viewer is to enable efficient single-cell analysis on of-the-shelf desktop computers or Laptops. However, the computationally demanding algorithms do pose certain requirements to the hardware. We recommend the following specifications for a smooth user experience.

* Windows 7 or higher (64bits)
* Intel Core i7 with 2 cores or better
* 8GB of memory or more
* Dedicated Graphics Card (preferably nVidia GTX 960 or better) with at least 2GB of GPU memory

Lesser configurations may work. Especially the memory requirements depend on the amount of data, please have an eye on the memory consumption if you run into problems. Systems without a dedicated Graphics Card might result in crashed during the visualization.

We have tested Cytosplore MTG Viewer on different configurations, including Windows 7 and Windows 10, intel Core i7 and intel Xeon CPUs as well as different Graphics Cards (nvidia GTX 980, GTX 1080, GTX Titan, AMD Radeon r9 M290, and AMD Radeon Pro 460). If you have any problems just [send us a mail][mail], including your configuration.
