**The Cytosplore installation was successful, but when I try to run it I get an error message saying that VCOMP120.DLL was not found.**

 The error relates to the Microsoft Visual Studio runtime, which should be installed automatically, but it seems something went off the rails there. You can download the necessary files directly from Microsoft at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784){:target="_blank_"}
